# Installation Instructions

To install any of the above libraries, you can use the `pip` command followed by the library name. Here are general steps to install these libraries:

1. **Open your command line or terminal.**
2. **Type the following command to install the desired library:**

   ```sh
   pip install <library_name>
   ```

   Replace `<library_name>` with the name of the library you wish to install. For example, to install NumPy, you would use:

   ```sh
   pip install numpy
   ```

3. **Wait for the installation to complete.**

### Example Installation

To install multiple libraries at once, you can list them all in a single `pip install` command:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy scikit-learn xgboost lightgbm catboost opencv-python scikit-image pillow tensorflow keras torch torchvision mxnet
```

This command will install all the listed libraries in one go.
